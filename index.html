      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <h2>Jennifer's Year-End Top 5 Lists</h2>
      <p>Melanie Goo couldn't have said it better when she said, <q>It was tough picking out titles for a list signifying the cream of the crop when<br>
        there were so many great works released by Asian/Asian Americans this year. The number of narratives that relate to the Asian American<br>
        experience is expanding, showing that we don't all fall under that Model Asian stereotype.</q></p>
      <h3><u>Top 5 Books of the Year</u></h3>
         <blockquote>What make these titles different from the rest is that they have made a lasting impression on me, and I continue to recall<br>
           their work for the impact it has made on me through its characters, story development, prose and emotions.</blockquote>

       <h3><u>Top 5 Documentaries of the Year</u></h3>
         <blockquote>These works were chosen because of the <b>eye-opening revelations</b> it made about the world or communities where the issue at hand<br>
            is not given much press or attention.</blockquote>
